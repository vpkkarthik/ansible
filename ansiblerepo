Yum is -install/update/remove/modify
service/systemctl =enable/start/stop/shutdown/restart/disable
anisble grouping [anyname]followed by IP
Target --ALL  - particular -grouping
**********
-b is a become root user
action call state--present/lates=install
absent =uninstall
started=start
stopped=stop
restarted=restart
#ansible grouping -i invenroty.txt -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present/latets"
#ansible grouping -i inventory-txt -m service or systemctl -a "name=httpd state=started"
